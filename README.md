# ‚úçÔ∏è Handwriting Recognition with EMNIST

This project is a deep learning-based application that recognizes **handwritten cursive characters** using the **EMNIST ByClass** dataset. It supports preprocessing, segmentation, and classification of handwritten input via a Streamlit web app interface.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Character segmentation for cursive handwriting
- ‚úÖ CNN model trained on EMNIST dataset (uppercase, lowercase, digits)
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing using OpenCV (thresholding, resizing)
- ‚úÖ Real-time prediction with Streamlit interface
- ‚úÖ Modular structure with separate utilities
